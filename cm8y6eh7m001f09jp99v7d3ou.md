Hello Future Coders!

Welcome to Week 4 of our Python Adventures! This week, we’re going to have fun with two cool topics: **Simple Math (Arithmetic)** and **Mixing Words (String Concatenation)**. By the end of today’s lesson, you'll be able to do basic math with Python and join words together to create awesome sentences!

---

## What You'll Learn

* **Arithmetic:** Learn how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
    
* **String Concatenation:** Discover how to join words and sentences using the `+` operator.
    
* Make your programs interactive and fun by combining math and text!

## 1\. Simple Arithmetic in Python

### What is Arithmetic?

Arithmetic is just another word for **math**. In Python, we use special symbols (operators) to do math with numbers:

* **Addition (**`+`): Adds numbers together.
    
* **Subtraction (**`-`): Takes one number away from another.
    
* **Multiplication (**`*`): Multiplies numbers.
    
* **Division (**`/`): Divides one number by another.
    

### Examples

```python
# Addition
print(2 + 3)  # This prints: 5

# Subtraction
print(10 - 4)  # This prints: 6

# Multiplication
print(4 * 5)  # This prints: 20

# Division
print(20 / 4)  # This prints: 5.0
```

> **Kid Tip:**  
> Think of addition like stacking your toy blocks to make a taller tower, and subtraction like taking some blocks away!

## 2\. String Concatenation in Python

### What is String Concatenation?

String concatenation means **joining words together**. In Python, we use the `+` operator to stick words together.

### Example

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Emma"
print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")
```

**Output:**

```python
Hello, Emma!
```

> **Kid Tip:**  
> Imagine you have two pieces of a sticker: one says "Hello" and the other says "Emma." When you stick them together, you make a cool greeting sticker!

## 3\. Interactive Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Math Helper

Write a simple program that asks for two numbers and then prints their **sum, difference, and product**.

**Example Code:**

```python
num1 = 8
num2 = 5
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)
print("Difference:", num1 - num2)
print("Product:", num1 * num2)
```

*Try changing the numbers to see what happens!*

---

### Challenge 2: The Talking Calculator

Make a program that asks for your favorite number, adds 10 to it, and prints a fun message.

**Example Code:**

```python
favorite_number = int(input("What is your favorite number? "))
print("Your favorite number plus 10 is:", favorite_number + 10)
```

*Remember: We use* `int()` to turn your text into a number so Python can do the math!

---

### Challenge 3: Mix and Match Words

Create a program that joins different pieces of text to make a sentence.

**Example Code:**

```python
part1 = "Python is"
part2 = "awesome!"
print(part1 + " " + part2)
```

*Now, try making your own sentence with your favorite words!*

## 4\. Quiz Time!

Let's check what you've learned:

1. **What does the** `+` operator do when used with numbers?
    
    * A) Joins them together
        
    * B) Adds them together
        
    * C) Divides them
        
2. **What is string concatenation?**
    
    * A) Adding numbers
        
    * B) Joining words together
        
    * C) Multiplying letters
        
3. **Which code correctly converts a user’s input into a number for math?**
    
    * A) `favorite = input("Enter your favorite number: ")`
        
    * B) `favorite = int(input("Enter your favorite number: "))`
        
    * C) `print("Enter your favorite number: ")`
        
4. **What will this code do?**
    
    ```python
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print(f"Hello {name}, nice to meet you!")
    ```
    
    * A) It will print "Hello name, nice to meet you!"
        
    * B) It will greet you using your name.
        
    * C) It will show an error.

## 5\. Recap & Reflection

### Key Takeaways:

* **Arithmetic:**
    
    * Python helps you do math using symbols like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
        
* **String Concatenation:**
    
    * The `+` operator lets you join words together.
        
* **Interactive Coding:**
    
    * By combining `input()` and `print()`, you can create fun programs that both do math and mix words to make cool messages.
        

### Discussion Prompt:

Imagine you’re creating a magic calculator. What fun message would you print when you add two numbers together? Write your idea down and share it with the class next time!

## What’s Next?

In our next lesson, we’ll dive into **Conditionals (if/else)**. Get ready to learn how to make decisions in your programs—just like a smart robot that knows what to do in different situations!
