## **Welcome, Young Coders!**

Last time, we learned how to talk to our robot friends using Python and made them say **"Hello, World!"**. Now, imagine if our robot could **remember things** like its name, age, and favorite color! That’s where **variables** come in. Today, we’ll explore how to store information using **variables and data types** in Python.

## **🔍 What Are Variables?**

Think of a **variable** as a special container where we can store information. It’s like a **backpack** where you keep your school supplies. When you need something, you take it out!

### **🎒 Real-Life Example:**

Imagine you have a backpack labeled **"Lunch"**. Inside, you put your favorite snack. When it’s time to eat, you open it up and take out your snack!

**In Python, we store information the same way:**

```python
snack = "Apple"
print("I have a", snack, "in my backpack!")
```

Output:

```python
I have a Apple in my backpack!
```

Cool, right? Now let’s explore what kind of things we can store!

## **🧮 Different Types of Data in Python**

Python has different kinds of data, just like your backpack can hold books, pencils, and snacks!

### **1️⃣ Numbers (Integers & Floats)**

Numbers help computers count things. There are two main types:

✅ **Integers (**`int`) → Whole numbers like **5, 10, 42**  
✅ **Floats (**`float`) → Decimal numbers like **3.14, 2.5, 99.99**

📌 **Example:**

```python
age = 10      # Integer
height = 4.5  # Float
print("I am", age, "years old and", height, "feet tall.")
```

💡 **Try It!** Change the numbers and see what happens!

### **2️⃣ Text (Strings -** `str`)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742118863251/57c31e0b-2197-480f-b1e0-24ba99bb282d.png align="center")

A **string** is just text inside quotes **(" " or ' ')**. We use it when we want Python to remember words, names, or even sentences!

📌 **Example:**

```python
robot_name = "Zeno"
print("My robot's name is", robot_name)
```

🤖 **Try It!** Change `"Zeno"` to your own robot’s name!

---

### **3️⃣ True or False (Booleans -** `bool`)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742118948653/185a2d38-c41f-495a-8f0c-41cae3f935e6.png align="center")

Computers love **YES or NO** answers. That’s why we have **Booleans**:

✅ `True` → Yes  
❌ `False` → No

📌 **Example:**

```python
robot_can_fly = False
print("Can my robot fly?", robot_can_fly)
```

## **🔍 Recap: What Did We Learn?**

✔ **Variables** store information in Python (like labeled boxes!)  
✔ **Data types** help us store different kinds of information:

* **Numbers** (`int`, `float`) → `10`, `3.14`
    
* **Strings** (`str`) → `"Hello!"`
    
* **True/False** (`bool`) → `True`, `False`  
    ✔ We can use **print()** to display our variables!
